    "section": "1.2 Data Sourcing",
    "text": "1.2 Data Sourcing\nOur analysis begins with base data obtained from the National Center of Education Statistics (NCES), a federal agency appointed to serve the U.S. Department of Education. This data comes from two primary surveys:\n\nThe Common Core of Data (CCD)\n\nThe Private School Survey (PSS)\n\nBoth surveys integrate data from additional sources, including state dropout and completion data files and the Local Education Agency Universal Survey. Additionally, finance data was utilized for certain variables. These datasets were originally collected by the Institute of Education Sciences to analyze education trends and further initiatives to improve access to higher education.\nWhile the data is accessible directly from the NCES, the retrieval process can be tedious, as it is collected at state and local levels.\nIn our clean_data.R script, we used the tidyverse package to efficiently manipulate and prepare the data for analysis. The script:\n\nReads an RData file (clean_data.R) located in the datasets directory.\n\nSaves the cleaned version as an RDS file (our_data_clean.rds) in the scripts directory using the saveRDS() function.\n\nUses readRDS() to ensure the cleaned data can be accessed easily for further exploration.\n\n\n\n1.3 Key Variables in Cleaned Data Set\nThe cleaned dataset contains the following variables:\n\nSchool-Level Data:\n\nSchool Name\n\nState Name\n\nGrades 1-8 Students\n\nGrades 9-12 Students\n\nMale Students / Female Students\n\nRace/Ethnicity Breakdown:\n\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native Students\n\nAsian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students\n\nHispanic Students\n\nWhite Students\n\nNative Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Students\n\nOther Variables:\n\nPupil/Teacher Ratio\n\n\nWe selected these variables based on their relevance as potential contributing factors to school enrollment trends.\n- Race/Ethnicity reflects cultural disparities and access to resources in segregated communities, making it essential for analyzing systemic issues.\n- Gender was included due to existing disparities in mental health and learning outcomes between males and females.\n- Pupil/Teacher Ratio was considered because lower-income communities often experience resource shortages, which can affect school enrollment and perceived quality.\n\n\n\n1.4 Government-Aided Lunch Program Data\n\nsuppressWarnings(\n  source(\"scripts/gov_lunch_program.R\", echo = FALSE)\n)\n\nNew names:\nRows: 104702 Columns: 75\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(75): ...1, ...2, ...3, ...4, ...5, ...6, ...7, ...8, ...9, ...10, ...11...\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `` -&gt; `...1`\n• `` -&gt; `...2`\n• `` -&gt; `...3`\n• `` -&gt; `...4`\n• `` -&gt; `...5`\n• `` -&gt; `...6`\n• `` -&gt; `...7`\n• `` -&gt; `...8`\n• `` -&gt; `...9`\n• `` -&gt; `...10`\n• `` -&gt; `...11`\n• `` -&gt; `...12`\n• `` -&gt; `...13`\n• `` -&gt; `...14`\n• `` -&gt; `...15`\n• `` -&gt; `...16`\n• `` -&gt; `...17`\n• `` -&gt; `...18`\n• `` -&gt; `...19`\n• `` -&gt; `...20`\n• `` -&gt; `...21`\n• `` -&gt; `...22`\n• `` -&gt; `...23`\n• `` -&gt; `...24`\n• `` -&gt; `...25`\n• `` -&gt; `...26`\n• `` -&gt; `...27`\n• `` -&gt; `...28`\n• `` -&gt; `...29`\n• `` -&gt; `...30`\n• `` -&gt; `...31`\n• `` -&gt; `...32`\n• `` -&gt; `...33`\n• `` -&gt; `...34`\n• `` -&gt; `...35`\n• `` -&gt; `...36`\n• `` -&gt; `...37`\n• `` -&gt; `...38`\n• `` -&gt; `...39`\n• `` -&gt; `...40`\n• `` -&gt; `...41`\n• `` -&gt; `...42`\n• `` -&gt; `...43`\n• `` -&gt; `...44`\n• `` -&gt; `...45`\n• `` -&gt; `...46`\n• `` -&gt; `...47`\n• `` -&gt; `...48`\n• `` -&gt; `...49`\n• `` -&gt; `...50`\n• `` -&gt; `...51`\n• `` -&gt; `...52`\n• `` -&gt; `...53`\n• `` -&gt; `...54`\n• `` -&gt; `...55`\n• `` -&gt; `...56`\n• `` -&gt; `...57`\n• `` -&gt; `...58`\n• `` -&gt; `...59`\n• `` -&gt; `...60`\n• `` -&gt; `...61`\n• `` -&gt; `...62`\n• `` -&gt; `...63`\n• `` -&gt; `...64`\n• `` -&gt; `...65`\n• `` -&gt; `...66`\n• `` -&gt; `...67`\n• `` -&gt; `...68`\n• `` -&gt; `...69`\n• `` -&gt; `...70`\n• `` -&gt; `...71`\n• `` -&gt; `...72`\n• `` -&gt; `...73`\n• `` -&gt; `...74`\n• `` -&gt; `...75`\n\n\nFrom the same ELSI data source, we incorporated data on federal aid programs (Free and Reduced Lunch Programs). This dataset, labeled ELSI_aid, includes:\n\nState Name\n\nSchool Name\n\nTotal number of students receiving:\n\nFree Lunch (split by race and age)\n\nReduced Price Lunch (split by race and age)\n\n\nLowest and highest grades offered by the school.\n\nYou can load it here: cleaning script.\nWe were specifically interested in understanding whether participation in aid programs varies across racial groups and whether these trends differ by state.\n\n\n\n1.5 Additional Census Data\nTo add further depth to our analysis, we sourced demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau. This auxiliary dataset provides information about each state’s racial breakdown at the county level. By cross-referencing this data with school locations, we aimed to identify regional patterns in enrollment trends.\nThe following variables were included in this dataset:\nINSERT VARIABLES HERE."

This differs from our school enrollment dataset, which classifies Hispanic as a race.\nTo address this discrepancy:\n- We created a new Hispanic category from the Census ethnicity data.\n- Adjusted the remaining racial categories proportionally to reflect non-Hispanic populations.\nWhile this approach is not a perfect representation, it preserves the general proportions needed for meaningful analysis."

This helps to illustrate the extent of school segregation that takes place in our country."

    "text": "Section 3: Statistical Modeling\n\n3.1 - Modeling\nTwo models were used, namely, a negative binomial regression, and a logistic regression. Running the code below gives summary statistics with estimated coefficients and p values. For the negative binomial model, coefficients were exponentiated to convert them into rate ratios. Example interpretation: American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23 has a rate ratio of 1.0023239. This means that, for every additional American Indian/Alaska Native student at a school, we can expect the count of free-lunch program enrolments at that school to increase by 0.23%. The first plot below shows the rate ratios for each race. Also, based on the summary statistics, all races have a statistically significant p value at the 5% level, and Asian students were the only race with a rate ratio slightly less than 1. This implies that for every additional Asian student at a school, we can expect the count of free-lunch program enrolments at that school to decrease very slightly. The plot below shows that American Indian/Alaska Native students brought the most impact into their schools regarding increasing free-lunch enrollment, while White and Asian students are much less impactful. There is also a relatively larger variance for American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and Two or More Races students as opposed to the rest of the groups.\n\nlibrary(MASS) # Used for negative binomial regression\n\n\nAttaching package: 'MASS'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    select\n\ndata$`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`Free Lunch Eligible [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`White Students [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`White Students [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander [Public School] 2022-23` &lt;- as.numeric(data$`Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2022-23`)\ndata$`Nat.

Running the code would produce summary statistics and the second plot below illustrates the relationship. We did a regression on estimating the probability of a school having the majority of its students enrolled in a free-lunch program based on the percentage of minority students the school has. minority_percentage has a statistically significant odds coefficient of 1.0397006 at the 5% level, implying that a 1 percentage point increase in a school’s minority population is associated with a 3.97% increase in the odds that a school has the majority of its students enrolled in a free lunch program. It can also be seen that, as the percentage of minority students at a school increases, the probability of the majority of a school’s students being enrolled in a free lunch program increases exponentially, based on the nonlinear and positive relationship illustrated.\n\n# Logistic Regression\ndata &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(minority_percentage = ((`Black or African American Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Hispanic Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `American Indian/Alaska Native Students [Public School] 2022-23` + `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander [Public School] 2022-23` + `Nat.

There seems to be an evident racial disparity according to these models, where certain minority races have a greater impact on a school’s total free-lunch enrolment numbers than others, and that schools with a higher minority percentage of their student population tend to have higher chances of the majority of their student body being enrolled in these programs. This raises some questions on the factors contributing to this disparity. Does a greater proportion of American Indian/Alaska Native students or their families meet the requirements to be enrolled in a lunch program compared to Asian students? If enrollment is not automatic, could it be that students or families of certain races are more willing to apply for these free lunch programs?\n\n\n3.2 - Limitations\nThe two or more races variable might have some confounding effects on the rest of the variables (if the data collection survey allowed for people to select multiple races, i.e. selecting White + Asian rather than the singular two or more races option, then the confounding effects might be even more severe). This could lead to bias induced in the estimated rate ratios for each race. Multicollinearity might also be a problem, as it may be likely that schools with a high percentage of a certain minority group might also have a high percentage of another minority group. Another problem with the two or more races variable is that there is a lot of ambiguity, and potentially varied results if we were to split it up into the different racial combinations. For example, students who are black and asian might have different results compared to students who are hispanic and black. Having this specific information could result in better estimates for each race."

    "text": "Data Cleaning\nDuring initial data cleaning, we identified negative values in student number columns, which we removed along with entries marked with symbols (e.g., ‘-’, ‘†’, ‘‡’) for missing or inapplicable data. Moving forward, we plan to restructure the data to address our primary research questions from Blog Post 1, including creating tables sorted by academic year, grade, and gender.\nWe also found inconsistencies in state name formatting—some, like Texas, were fully capitalized, leading to them being treated as distinct entities. To resolve this, we plotted a bar chart of public schools by state to verify these discrepancies. After confirming this issue, we used the mutate function to standardize state names, capitalizing the first letter (e.g., converting TEXAS to Texas) to unify them.\nAdditionally, while cleaning for missing values, we observed that rows with excessive N/A values were being removed, which inadvertently led to the loss of many state names and potential bias in our analysis.\nIn the future, to avoid warnings, we will also ensure that all columns have appropriate data types.\nPreliminary Data Analysis\nTo explore primary insights that our dataset could provide, we plotted a bar chart with the number of schools in each state.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ readr     2.1.5     \n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\nsuppressWarnings(\nour_data_clean &lt;- read_rds(here::here(\"dataset/our_data_clean.rds\")))\n\n\nour_data_clean &lt;- our_data_clean |&gt;\n  filter_all(all_vars(as.numeric(.) &gt;= 0 | is.na(as.numeric(.)))) |&gt;\n  mutate(`State Name [Public School] Latest available year` = str_to_title(`State Name [Public School] Latest available year`)) |&gt;\n  mutate(across(-c(`School Name`, `State Name [Public School] Latest available year`), as.numeric))\n\nWarning: There were 4 warnings in `filter()`.\nThe first warning was:\nℹ In argument: `&...`.\nCaused by warning in `` as.numeric(`School Name`) &gt;= 0 | is.na(as.numeric(`School Name`)) ``:\n!

This is followed by Michigan, Florida and Alaska. On the other hand, states like Rhode Island, North Dakota and Indiana, have the lowest number of public schools.\nOutlier Analysis\nWe selected five states to analyze potential outliers in school student numbers.\n\n# Selecting states to plots\n\nunique_states = unique(our_data_clean$`State Name [Public School] Latest available year`)\n\nselected_states &lt;- our_data_clean[our_data_clean$`State Name [Public School] Latest available year` %in% unique_states[1:11], ]\n\n# Outlier Analysis \n\nggplot(selected_states, aes(x = `State Name [Public School] Latest available year`, \n                             y = `Grades 1-8 Students [Public School] 2022-23`)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill = \"lightblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Boxplot of Total Grade 1-8 Students by State in 2022-23\",\n       x = \"States\",\n       y = \"Count of Students\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Rotate x-axis labels to vertical\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph indicates that Pennsylvania has significant outliers, with one school reporting over 10,000 Grade 1-8 students. We also see the spread of outliers being the greatest for Pennsylvania schools. Moreover, one can observe that the interquartile range for states differ. For example, Colorado has the biggest interquartile range, showing that the middle half of the data, for the number of students in Colorado schools, is spread out. On the other hand, Minnesota has a seemingly lower IQR.\nInvestigating potential relations between Variables\nWe wanted to investigate if we found any correlation between our variables. For our preliminary check, we investigated a potential relationship between number of male and female students enrolled in public schools from 2022-23.\n\nggplot(our_data_clean, aes(x = `Male Students [Public School] 2022-23`, y = `Male Students [Public School] 2022-23`)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Scatterplot of Male vs. Female Students 2022-23\",\n       x = \"Number of Male Students\",\n       y = \"Number of Female Students\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we see from the graph below, there exists a strong linear correlation between the Male and Female students, possibly suggesting evidence of multicollinearity exisiting between the two."

    "text": "How are you continuing your exploratory data analysis?\nWe started by exploring the dependency on aid programs in public schools relative to the minority populations in those areas. Initially, we focused on identifying states and schools with the highest minority populations. However, we encountered a limitation: some schools with minimal data had a student body population consisting entirely of minority students. As a result, we decided to shift focus to the top 10 largest states rather than individual schools.\n\n\n\nFinal Difference Table\n\n\nThis way, we will be able to compare analysis done between our initial data set and the second dataset using a larger sample that is more representative of the surrounding population. The latter dataset, sourced from the geo census, incorporates racial breakdowns by state, and having this data will enable us to rationalize the values that we got from our initial analysis. For example, we will be able to compare how our racial breakdown in schools by state differs from the state in general. If there is a difference, we may want to further analyze which counties these differences come from.\nAdditionally, we have started doing some initial analysis using our second dataset. See our final difference table below:\n\n\n\nFinal Difference Table\n\n\nA Positive value means the 0-17 census data reflects a lesser proportion of this race than the school enrollment data does. Thus, a positive value means public school enrollment over represents such race. A negative value means such race is underrepresented in public school enrollment.\nHere is an analysis of some of the largest states’ White population.\nCalifornia: 0.07 (7%)\nCalifornia’s public school enrollment appears to over-represent White children by 7 percent. This could be because of a few factors. California has a very large Mexican immigrant population. It is possible that fewer immigrants are enrolling in public schools because of concerns about legal status/deportation. This is a hypothesis but there are likely many factors.\nFlorida: -0.004 (0.04%)\nFlorida’s result difference for White population is extremely close to zero, which indicates whites are nearly perfectly represented in school enrollment.\nTexas: 0.0003 (0.003%)\nTexas’s result difference for White population is also very close to zero.\nGeorgia: -0.015 (1.5%)\nWhite children appear to be slightly underrepresented in Georgia public schools. In contrast with California, GA has a large Black/African American population. Due to structural racism/factors, the median income of White families in GA is 51 percent higher than the median income of Black families in GA. Thus, it is possible that more White families can afford to send their kids to private school, thus creating this underrepresentation.\nThesis: There is an increased dependency on aid programs in states with larger populations of minority groups such as African Americans, Hispanics, etc.\nWe plan to:\n\nExamine how minority groups navigate the school system and how their academic performance compares to other groups.\nCompare the initial dataset vs. the merged dataset to see how patterns differ (if at all).\nInvestigate regional or county-level differences in minority representation.\n\nVisualizations and Tables\nWe will want to ensure that the color scheme we have used for all of our plots is the same, and if possible, representative of what we are trying to show. We may try to have the same race represented by the same color throughout our project so that it is easiest for viewers to track how that population has changed over time. This, in addition to legends and proper labels, will be quite helpful. Additionally, we want to make sure that we have appropriate chart labels across all of our visualizations - this includes titles, axis labels, etc. Lastly, it’ll be of utmost importance that we select the appropriate graphs for each of the things we want to visualize. We should double check our work to make sure that we are not using visualization types that aren’t appropriate (ex: a linear model for a categorical variable). During this process, we should also make sure that all our visualizations are readable and interpretable."

    "text": "These are the steps that you will take today to get started on your project. Today, you will just be brainstorming, and then next week, you’ll get started on the main aspects of the project.\n\nStart by introducing yourselves to each other. I also recommend creating a private channel on Microsoft Teams with all your team members. This will be a place that you can communicate and share ideas, code, problems, etc.\nDiscuss what aspects of the project each of you are more or less excited about. These include\n\nCollecting, cleaning, and munging data ,\nStatistical Modeling,\nVisualization,\nWriting about analyses, and\nManaging and reviewing team work.\n\nBased on this, discuss where you feel your strengths and weaknesses might be.\nNext, start brainstorming questions you hope to answer as part of this project. This question should in some way be addressing issues around racial disparities. The questions you come up with should be at the level of the question we started with when exploring the HMDA data. (“Are there differences in the ease of securing a loan based on the race of the applicant?”) You’ll revise your questions a lot over the course of the project. Come up with a few questions that your group might be interested in exploring.\nBased on these questions, start looking around for data that might help you analyze this. If you are looking at U.S. based data, data.gov is a good source and if you are looking internationally, I recommend checking out the World Bank. Also, try Googling for data. Include “data set” or “dataset” in your query. You might even include “CSV” or some other format. Using “data” by itself in your query often doesn’t work too well. Spend some time searching for data and try to come up with at least three possible data sets. (For your first blog post, you’ll write short proposals about each of them that I’ll give feedback on.)\nCome up with a team name. Next week, I’ll provide the Github Classroom assignment that will be where you work on your final project and you’ll have to have your team name finalized by then. Your project will be hosted online at the website with a URL like sussmanbu.github.io/ma4615-fa23-final-project-TEAMNAME.\n\nNext time, you’ll get your final project website set up and write your first blog post."

    "text": "Dataset 1: Health Insurance Coverage in the USA 1979-2019\nThe dataset is sourced from the Economic Policy Institute’s State of Working America Data Library, which offers a comprehensive collection of economic data. The data was originally collected through EPI’s analysis of Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata. This dataset primarily focuses on employer-sponsored health insurance (ESI) coverage among private-sector workers in the United States. The “Health Insurance Coverage in the USA (1979-2019)” dataset from Kaggle contains data spanning 40 years, from 1979 to 2019, tracking various types of insurance coverage in the U.S. We’ve been able to load the dataset to see that it consists of 41 rows (representing each year) and 17 columns that cover demographic information, such as race, gender, coverage, and education level.\nSome questions we aim to answer include:\n\nComparing the ESI coverage rates among different demographic groups (e.g., race, gender, education level) and analyze any disparities or variations.\nDetermining the demographic group with the highest/lowest ESI coverage rate and investigating the underlying factors contributing to the difference.\nEvaluating the impact of education level on ESI coverage and exploring how coverage rates differ for high school graduates versus college graduates.\n\nSome challenges we anticipate facing while answering these questions are:\n\nMissing data from earlier years or specific subgroups could skew results.\nUnderstanding how different policies impacted insurance coverage at different points can be complex.\nAggregated data might not show nuances at the state level\n\nDataset 2: 2022-2023 Public School Enrollments by Race/Ethnicity\nThis is a sample table created by the data set provided by the National Center for Education Statistics, sourced from Common Core of Data. The dataset is highly customizable, allowing for the selection of additional variables, sorting, and deletion of columns as needed. The current sample table includes 14 columns and over 10,000 rows. The data is available in both CSV and Excel formats, making it easy to load and clean using standard data processing tools. The data was originally collected by the NCES to provide a comprehensive, annual accounting of public elementary and secondary education in the U.S. It covers key metrics such as enrollment, demographics, and funding across various school districts, helping to inform educational policy and research. The data can be loaded easily, and any necessary cleaning or transformations (e.g., handling missing values, renaming columns) can be performed once loaded into a data processing tool.\nThe main questions we aim to address include:\n\nWhat does racial enrollment look like in public schools across the country?\nDo certain racial groups experience decreased enrollment as they progress through higher levels of education?\nHow does district funding differ in predominantly White districts compared to predominantly POC districts?\nWhat is the racial disparity in enrollment between private and public schools?\nHow have racial trends in enrollment evolved over time for both public and private schools/districts?\n\nSome challenges might include:\n\nThe large size of the dataset (especially when including additional years) may require more computational resources.\nMissing or incomplete data could introduce bias or skew the results, making it necessary to account for these gaps during analysis.\n\nDataset 3: Households in Mobile Homes (Percent) by Race/Ethnicity\nThis data set is provided by diversitydatakids.org, an organization that aims to provide equitable opportunities for children. The data set has information for different states and the percentage of mobile homes based on race and ethnicity, with 459 rows and 17 columns - spanning from years 2009 to 2017. Since the organization’s main aim is to create equitable opportunities for children, they are focused on facilitating a “rigorous, equity-focused” research program that could possibly contribute to policy change regarding resource allocation. The data is downloadable once registered, has filters and a data dictionary for the columns - which could be useful for data cleaning. It also has a data API for accessing the dataset.\nThe main questions we aim to answer include:\n\nDoes the number of people living in mobile homes differ significantly across racial demographics?\nOver the years, has there been a change in the demographics that live in mobile homes? How has this change been different for certain states as compared to others?\nHas the total number of people living in mobile homes changed between 2009 and 2017? Can we observe a trend?\n\nSome challenges we may face:\n\nMissing values in the dataset could skew results.\nRemoval of missing values during data cleaning could potentially lead to loss of valuable information.\nCertain states are missing data for specific years, which could be challenging when comparing that state to another."

This provides an overall picture to compare enrollment growth rate over the years for different states. For instance, we see states like New Mexico with the highest growth rate of 14.99%, compared to New York and Virginia that had growth rates of -0.1% and -0.35% respectively. This gives an opportunity to further investigate why some states have extremely high or low enrollment growth rates, and if this reflects growth rates of certain demographics as well.\nIn the plot below, we have considered 5 states with the largest absolute growth rates in enrollment from 2018 to 2022.\n\nmodel_data &lt;- our_data_clean |&gt;\n  mutate(`Grades 1-8 Students [Public School] 2022-23` = as.numeric(`Grades 1-8 Students [Public School] 2022-23`), \n         `Grades 9-12 Students [Public School] 2022-23` = as.numeric(`Grades 9-12 Students [Public School] 2022-23`), \n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2022-23` = as.numeric(\n           `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2022-23`),\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2021-22` = as.numeric(\n           `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2021-22`),\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2020-21` = as.numeric(\n           `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2020-21`),\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2019-20` = as.numeric(\n           `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2019-20`),\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2018-19` = as.numeric(\n           `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2018-19`)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(`School Name`, `State Name [Public School] Latest available year`,\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2022-23`,\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2021-22`,\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2020-21`,\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2019-20`,\n         `Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] 2018-19`\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(`State Name [Public School] Latest available year` %in% c(\"Alaska\", \"Arkansas\", \"Delaware\", \"New Mexico\", \"Wisconsin\"))\n\n# Modify the data processing to clean the year column properly\nmodel_data_long &lt;- model_data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = starts_with(\"Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students\"),\n    names_to = \"Academic Year\",\n    values_to = \"Asian Students\",\n    names_prefix = \"Asian or Asian/Pacific Islander Students [Public School] \"\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    `Academic Year` = as.numeric(gsub(\"[^0-9]\", \"\", `Academic Year`))  # Remove non-numeric characters safely\n  )\n\n# Check for any NAs in the `Academic Year` column and remove them if necessary\nmodel_data_long &lt;- model_data_long |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(`Academic Year`))\n\n# Plot the data\nggplot(model_data_long, aes(x = `Academic Year`, y = `Asian Students`)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, color = \"red\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ `State Name [Public School] Latest available year`) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Linear Trend of Asian Student Population Over Time by State\",\n    x = \"Academic Year\",\n    y = \"Number of Asian Students\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022),  # Specify the years you want to show\n    labels = c(\"2018\", \"2019\", \"2020\", \"2021\", \"2022\")  # Custom labels (optional)\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo build statistical models, we chose a Linear model to examine any overall linear trends in the enrollment of Asian students, in the top 5 states that demonstrated the highest percentage change in enrollment. From the plots, faceted by state, we observe that states like Delaware demonstrated the highest growth rate of Asian students. Whereas, states like New Mexico and Wisconsin showed almost no change.\nWe plan to investigate why some states (like New Mexico that displayed a high growth rate in enrollment) does not reflect a high growth rate for demographics like Asian students, and whether we find a similar trend with other demographics.\nExpanding the Dataset\nAs we look to expand our dataset, we plan to include additional categorical variables that could enhance our analysis. For example, by segmenting (or “faceting”) the data by public schools, we could incorporate the number of government-funded programs—such as free or reduced lunch and language support for non-native English speakers. Using linear modeling, we could then explore whether the number of students in these programs tends to increase in schools within districts with larger minority populations. Additionally, if we are able to acquire more data for private schools, we could compare program participation rates between public and private schools.\nAlternatively, by faceting the data by state, we could examine dropout rates broken down by race/ethnicity, gender, and grade level. This would allow us to model dropout trends over time, analyzing whether dropout rates change as students advance through their education. We could also investigate dropout patterns in economically disadvantaged districts and those with higher proportions of minority students, using logistic modeling to better understand these relationships.\nAnother variable to consider is the number of diploma recipients, categorized by gender and race/ethnicity. Similar to our analysis of dropout rates, we could use this data to model and predict graduation levels across different types of districts, such as those with high minority populations or lower economic resources."

Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source? The data comes from the National Center of Education Statistics, a federal agency appointed to serve the U.S. department of education. The data is collected using two primary surveys: The Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Survey (PSS). The data from these two surveys come from a collection of other sources; primarily the state dropout and completion data file, and Local Education Agency Universal Survey. Finance data was also utilized for certain variables. The Institute of Education Sciences collected the data to analyze “education trends”, to further initiatives to improve access to higher education. Finding the data from the original source is possible but tedious, as data is collected by state and locally.\nAre there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way? The data is collected through two surveys: the Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Survey (PSS). This sample population includes both public and private schools across the nation, ranging from elementary to secondary education. One notable issue is the data scarcity at the high school level and beyond, where information becomes limited. Additionally, there is potential for bias, as not all public schools use the Common Core standards; in fact, only 41 out of 50 states implement Common Core. This may result in a dataset that is biased towards those self-selecting into Common Core and disproportionately representative of certain states, potentially overlooking others.\nHow is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data? Is this data being used for some policy decisions? What questions have others asked about this data? One can find multiple research conducted on data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) and the Private School Survey (PSS). This includes investigating research questions like “How Many Central City High Schools Have A Severe Dropout Problem, Where Are They Located, and Who Attends Them?”, which looks at a geographic and demographic analysis of the data. Some reports have used the data to ask questions surrounding the Characteristics of At-Risk of school failure students. The NCES (National Center of Education Statistics) also has a Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates (EDGE) program which provides geospatial data and creates socio-economic and housing condition indicators for school-going children, that is provided to policymakers.

Beneficence plays a key role in our project, as we want to ensure our analysis and conclusions are insightful and that they do not harm any communities. One way we can do this is to be transparent about any limitations in the data and in our analysis. For example, instead of making unsupported conclusions that may harm the reputation of a particular group of people, we have to acknowledge the limitations of the data set and analysis. Not being transparent may also lead to potential misuse of the data or our results which can further harm certain communities. Respect for persons is another principle that is important to keep in mind when working with data. If we were the ones collecting data, it is crucial that the collection process includes informed consent, consideration for all groups of people, and respecting the privacy and personal details of the respondents. In relation to the public school enrollment data set, we could maintain this principle by ensuring the data we work with and the results of our project respect the privacy of the individuals. It is assumed that the data sets do not include any sensitive personal information but if that is not the case, it is something that can be dealt with in the cleaning phase and something to keep in mind when reporting our findings."

    "text": "Merging Data Process\nWe are in the process of creating a dataset on racial breakdowns of minor (under 18) populations by state. We are creating this dataset by utilizing the tidy census package to extract race data by age. More specifically, we utilized the “sex by age” concept in tidy census, which contains race counts for each sex and each age group. One current limitation is that the data in the tidy census treats hispanic not as a race, but as a separately applicable category. We plan to get around this by excluding those of hispanic origin from the other three categories. After we have done this and have a final data table, our plan is to cross reference with the race data of school enrollment statewide, to see which races are over/under represented in school enrollment, and how it differs by state.\nHow To Use Merged Data\nThe data that we currently have is related to the racial breakdown in public schools by state. However, we would like to bring together multiple datasets to enable a more in depth analysis. We would like to further explore how race has an effect on offerings in public schools - specifically special aid programs such as reduced lunch and free lunch.\nFrom the same website, we are also exploring categorical data regarding school type (regular or special education school), lowest and highest grades offered by the schools, and numerical data of the number of full time teachers, pupil/teacher ratio. These variables can be used to examine any patterns with the racial demographics of the students enrolled in the school. Variables such as pupil/teacher ratio, that can be faceted by racial demographics, could also be used to investigate any correlation to the dropout rates.\nBecause the data is coming from the same source, we have found a column to perform a join on - ‘School Name’. As this is a common column between the 2 datasets, we should be able to effectively combine information from the old and new data to create a comprehensive file detailing racial breakdown, enrollments, pupil:teacher ratios, and participants in aid programs. If we find that a join is not necessary, we may refer back to the original database and extend the columns of our original dataset.\nAfter extending the columns of our original dataset and successfully merging it with the tidycensus data, we aim to analyze how the demographic composition of the under-18 population in a given area correlates with the characteristics of surrounding public schools. Specifically, we will explore questions such as: Do these schools offer more government-assisted programs? Are their dropout rates higher? Do areas with certain demographic profiles have a greater number of private schools? Through this analysis, we hope to gain deeper insights into the socioeconomic conditions of these schools and better understand how these factors might influence the quality of education provided."

    "text": "Limitations of crossing data/our solution: As stated in Blog Post 5, there are different methods of collecting race data between tidy census and our school dataset. Tidycensus treats “Hispanic/Latino” as an ethnicity–thus a separate category. While our school enrollment dataset treats Hispanic as a race (like Black, White, Asian, etc). We decided the best method around this was to look at the 2nd category in the census, and create a new category of Hispanics. Then, shape the remaining categories proportionally to the remaining population. This obviously would not be a perfect representation but it would still keep general proportions.\nRacial Breakdown Of Hispanic Americans According to USA FACTS The Hispanic population has quadrupled in the past four decades. It is also becoming more diverse.\n65.6% White 25.7% some other race alone 5.0% multiracial 2.3% Black or African American 1.0% American Indian/Alaska Native 0.3% Asian 0.1% Hawaiian/pacific islander\nPublic VS Private Analysis. Once our dataset containing proportions of under 18 racial data from each state using tidy census is finalized, our goal is to also utilize the Private School data given in the original dataset. We will cross reference public school data with Private School data to see if racial proportion differences between public school enrollment and under 18 data can be explained by larger proportions of certain races choosing to attend private school instead of public.\nTo work towards this goal, we created a new dataset containing race proportions for each school using 2019-20 enrollment data; the private school data only contains sporadic years, and 2019-20 is the only one that both public and private had data for. However, given that there does not appear to be significant change in data from year to year (very strong autocorrelation), we believe that this will still allow us to make a strong conclusion."

The audience for this page is the general public (to the extent possible). Your thesis should be a statement, not a question.\nEach figure should be very polished and also not too complicated. There should be a clear interpretation of the figure so the figure has a clear purpose. Even something like a histogram can be difficult to interpret for non-experts.\n\nCreativity\n\nDo your best to make things interesting. Think of a story. Think of how each part of your analysis supports the previous part or provides a different perspective.\n\nInteractive component\n\nQuality and ease of use of the interactive components. Is it clear what can be explored using your interactive components? Does it enhance and reinforce your conclusions?\n\nThis page should be self-contained.\n\nNote: This page should have no code visible, i.e. use #| echo: FALSE."

You should provide a quick explanation of your data and demonstrate some of the conclusions from your EDA. This video should be no longer than 4 minutes. Include a link to your video (and password if needed) in your README.md file on your Github repository. You are not required to provide a link on the website. This can be presented by any subset of the team members.\n\n\nRest of the Site\nFinally, here are important things to keep in mind for the rest of the site.\nThe main title of your page is informative. Each post has an author/description/informative title. All lab required posts are present. Each page (including the home page) has a nice featured image associated with it. Your about page is up to date and clean. You have removed the generic posts from the initial site template."
